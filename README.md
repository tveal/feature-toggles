# Feature Toggles

Driving Idea: Have a centralized toggle server with in-memory db and REST API for retrieving real-time toggle values.

Why? The pursuit (and necessity) of [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). See [Feature Flags](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/feature-flags/), especially [Runtime Switchable](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/feature-flags/#runtime-switchable).

Goals:
- server:
    - REST API for toggle values
    - provide consumable client jar
    - Have UI for toggle management (set, add, remove)
    - Have in-memory and persistent toggle storage for server
    - SSE impl for toggle changes
- client jar (consumed in client-service):
    - Provide a method such as `ToggleClient.isFeatureEnabled("my-toggle")` that gets the first available value:
        1. server value
        2. `application.properties` on classpath of _client-service_
        3. default to false

## Build Things

### toggle-server and toggle-client

The `toggle-server` project contains the `toggle-client` subproject, collectively producing:
- build/libs/toggle-server-${version}.war
- toggle-client/build/libs/toggle-client-${version}.jar

```bash
# from toggle-server directory
./gradlew clean build
```

### sample-client-service

```bash
# from sample-client-service directory
./gradlew clean build
```


## Run Things Locally

Currently, `cargoRunLocal` gradle task doesn't show the slf4j logs, so use `bootRun` for now (faster but no ui for server). You should also periodically run `./gradlew clean build` in the respective directories when changing things.

### Server

```bash
# from toggle-server directory
./gradlew bootRun
```

Request toggle value with a url like:

http://localhost:8090/toggle-server/get-toggle?toggleId=my-feature

### Sample Client Service

```bash
# from sample-client-service directory
./gradlew bootRun
```

Visit the following url:

http://localhost:8900/sample-client-service
